# Project G07 - Remote Access GUI (Pre-release)

> A PyQt6 desktop Remote Access Tool (RAT) that uses the Discord API as a backend and places GUI control in the foreground. This repository is a pre-release and intended for educational purposes only. The UI aims to be the most beautiful GUI seen in a remote access tool - polish and features are still in progress.

## Important notice

This project is provided for educational and research purposes only. Do NOT deploy this software on systems you do not own or have explicit, written permission to manage. The authors and maintainers are not responsible for misuse.

## Summary

Project G07 is a desktop application built with PyQt6 that uses a Discord bot as a control channel for client commands. The GUI provides the following high-level capabilities:

- Real-time Clients dashboard with context actions
- Remote commands via Discord backend: screenshot, terminal, file explorer, system info, shutdown, restart, logoff
- Client builder utilities (for educational packaging and testing)
- Sound notifications and local configuration management

## Status

- Pre-release (alpha): known bugs exist. Expect visual and functional rough edges.
- Target platform: Windows (PowerShell friendly). PyQt6 recommended.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.10+ (3.11 recommended). Install dependencies:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration (Discord bot)

1. Create a Discord application and bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Enable "Message Content Intent" if required
3. Invite the bot to your server and note the bot token and guild ID
4. Configure the token and guild settings in the app's Settings page (within the GUI)

## Running the app

From the repository root:

```powershell
python main.py
```

## Notes on files and publishing

- The repo omits generated bytecode (`__pycache__`) and the `screenshots/` folder has been removed to keep the repo clean. The `sounds/` folder is kept.
- `config.json` may contain local settings; remove sensitive values before publishing.

## Caution & Legal

This software can be used for remote administration tasks. Only use it where you are explicitly authorized to do so. Unauthorized access to computers is illegal and unethical.
